# How do I get started?

If you want to jump in and start coding right away, the
[quickstart](quickstart.html) is the way to go.

If you would prefer to watch a narrated slideshow introduction, this is roughly similar to the presentation that was given at
[Bay Area Erlang Factory 2009](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBayAreaErlangFactory2009):

Some [blogs](blogs.html) also have posts that can serve as
useful introductions to Webmachine, if you prefer to start that way.

No matter how you get started, you'll probably want to come back and
read [more documentation](docs.html) once you get up and running.
