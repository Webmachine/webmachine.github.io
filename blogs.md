# What else can I read?

In addition to the documentation on this site and the [source
code](https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine), some useful
Webmachine writing can be found on blogs and elsewhere. A small
sampling of these is here:

* The [restful way](http://blog.therestfulway.com)
  blog is almost entirely dedicated to Webmachine.
* The [BeerRiot blog](http://blog.beerriot.com)
  contains multiple topics, including a wealth of examples and
  discussion of Webmachine.
* Paul Mineiro posted about [dynamically loading webmachine resources](http://dukesoferl.blogspot.com/2009/08/dynamically-loading-webmachine.html)
* There is a fairly low traffic [mailing list](http://lists.therestfulway.com/mailman/listinfo/webmachine_lists.therestfulway.com)
  for technical discussion of Webmachine.
